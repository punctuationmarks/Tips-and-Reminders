# Linters in Visual Studio Code

- Each project (Project1/ & Project2/) has a different prettier format setting. It is automatically chosen upon format (either on save, if set globally in VSCode or on `ctrl/cmd + i`).

  - Also note there are multple different ways to store the prettier preferences (.json and .js shown here)

- Also with a .vscode/settings.json, you can control settings on a "global" level (which in this case it's global to all of the paths below it's CWD, as far as I currently know)

- Taken from this [tutorial](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/configure-prettier-in-vscode/)
