# Basics
Notes:
_learned from OpenOffice Libre Calc although should theoretically work in both applications_
_check out the Excel spreadsheet in the folder for visual examples_


- Columns and rows
	- Make up cells (i.e. places where a row and column meet)
	- Each cell is named (e.g. named column then row, so D3 is the four column and third row)

- Records
	- An observation
	- An entire row that has column information filled out (can be null)

- Ranges
	- Any grouping of cells
	- Named by starting at the upper left through the lower right 
		- Syntax: `D10:G19`
		- Spoken english: D10 through G19

- Sheets
	- Each sheet is independent from each other
	- All sheets added together are called a "workbook"


- Movement through cells
	- Up/Down
		- Enter / Shift-Enter
	- Right/Left
		- Tab / Shift-Tab


- Being "on" a cell vs being "in" a cell
	- On a cell just means you've selected a cell
 		Which means Excel views it as the variable name, so you can override the contents
		or use the cell's name in a formula
	- In a cell means you are able to edit or alter the contents of the cell


- Edit a selected cell
	- F12
	_otherwise you'll just override the cell with whatever you're typing_


- Insert/Delete Rows
	- to insert an entire blank row/record/observation
	`shift-space` to select all columns in the desired row
	then `crtl-+` (plus sign) to insert a blank row/record/observation
	
	- Use the minus sign to delete the fully selected row.

		
- Insert Row/Column/varying sizes
	- `shift-ctrl-+` (plus sign) will open a drop box of "Insert whatever you want"

- Referencing a global cell
	- If you want to reference a cell that has global scope (which is default for all cells)
	- Reference the sheet first and then the cell
	i.e. `$Sheet2.$B$6`

## Functions 

	- In a cell, you can use "functions" to make calculations of other cells
		-e.g. if you want the average of all cells from F2 through F22, syntax is:
		```
			=average(F2:F22)
		```
		-e.g. if you want the sum of all cells from F2 through F22, syntax is:
		```
			=sum(F2:F22)
		```
	- Pretty much every mathematical function is built into excel,
	you can see an exhaustive list under the Function Wizard (in OpenOffice Calc) button
	where you can search for function options. Also, to the left of that is a list of recently 
	used functions




## Autofill
	- Coping
		- You can automatically copy text or data by selecting a single cell
		- Then clicking the bottom right of that cell (when the cursor turns into a cross-like object) 
		- Then dragging the "cross cursor" as far as you'd like to have copies of the original cell
	- Coping a pattern
		- Perhaps you have a numerical pattern that you want repeated
		- Do the same as coping a singe cell, but select a range instead
		- Excel will try to figure out the pattern and then repeat it for as long as you'd like
		- e.g. if a numbers in a column are increasing by 2 every cell, 
			then it'll follow that pattern starting where you started and 
			continue until you want it to stop.
		_Note this is not always accurate, double check the outcome_
	- Coping a formula
		- Same as coping a pattern, note it does this verbatim
	- Coping a pattern is especially helpful for time
		- e.g. if you started a column with "january" then it'll copy all the way 
		through the year if you want (and then continue to the next year's months in succession)
			- This also works with days of the week, full dates, times

_Keyboard shortcut of `crtl-d` or `crtl-r` (for copy/insert down or right) will copy, but doesn't seem to work on patterns_
_Need to do more research if this is needed		_


## Visual Helpers and Shortcuts

- Resize all cells
	- Select what range you want to have resized (can be your entire worksheet)
	- Then double click inbetween _any_ two cells (when the cursor looks like east/west arrows)
	- All of your cells will be resized to fit the data in their respective cells
	- This works on columns as well as rows

- Worksheet Title
	- If your worksheet has a title in cell A1 (or wherever)
	- Select cell and all of the columns in that row
	- Then click the "Merge and Center" button (near the "Alignment" section)
	- Then your title will still be in cell A1, but that cell will stretch over all of the other columns

- Conditional Formatting
	- You can format visually based on what the cells are
	- You can format based on entire worksheet or more likely a column
	- If you are using strings as conditions make sure to put them in quotes when entering in formulas

- Sorting
	- If you select the top right of your dataset (or you can select a range)
	- Under "Data" for LibreOffice there is a sort ascending/descending
	- This will sort from the first column

- Filtering
	- Select all of the headers of your dataset
	- Then click on Auto-Filter (or Filter) (under "Data" for LibreOffice)
	- Then you can click on the little arrow under the column header and "filter" out data
		-i.e. filter all dates between years/months/whatever
	- The data is not destroyed or deleted, just "hidden"
		- This is shown by the row numbers, some will be missing

- Keeping your column headers visible as the data increases on worksheet
	- Select first row under the headers
	- Under "View" there is option for "Freeze Cells" or "Freeze Panes"
	- Then as you scroll to any row over the visible area of your worksheet
	the headers will follow so you can see what cell in what column


## Named cells
	- Say you have a formula you would like to copy since as the cell are entered the 
	formula should be updated accordingly, which one of the cells/"variables" will be a "contant"
	while being used
		-i.e. a BMI calculator where the user has their height entered and you want to track their BMI
		as their weight changes over time, but most likely their height will not fluctuate
	- Select the cell, and on the top left dashboard where the name of the cell, override it by typing and pressing enter
	- Now you can use that "named cell" in your formula, so it stays the same while the rest of the variables change
