You have recently started working at a large company that implements a distributed switching network.  Your supervisor comes into your office to tell you that a user on the second floor is unable to connect to the network. He states that he thinks the problem is at the distribution layer and waits for a response. It's clearly a test to see if you know the function of the layers. Does his theory hold?

__No, end-user devices connect at the access layer.__


# This is in not in the text :/
In a distributed switching network what layer hosts network services?
