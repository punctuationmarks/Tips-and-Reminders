- Local Access Network
- Wide Access Network
- Multiple Access Network
- Virtual Local Access Network
- Media Access Control (MAC) Addresses

  - Unique hardware address hard-coded into a network adapter. Provides local addressing on Ethernet/WiFi networks. 48 bits long (6 bytes)and are represented by hexadecimal digits. The first half is from the manufacturer's organizationally unique identifier (OUI). Also called "burned-in addresses" or "physical addresses". The second half is a serial number, which can be changed for admin purposes.

  - Examples of valid MAC addresses
    - 00 : 0a : 87 : 5e : 44 : 2c
    - 000a . 875e . 442c
    - 000a875e442c

- Netwrok Interface Cards (NICs)

- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

- Half duplex
  - Each node is able to transmit and receive data, but not do both at the same time
- Full duplex
  - Each node is allowed to transmit and recieve simulatenously
- Byte
  - Eight bits
