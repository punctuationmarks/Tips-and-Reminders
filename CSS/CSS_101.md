# Terms


__rem__: rem units are relative to the root font size. So if the root font size is 16px, then a 4rem object is 64px. Nice about this is if the font size gets changed, everything relative to that font size stays at the same proportions. 

__vh__: vh units are relative to the size of the view port. `100vh` will fill up 100% the size of the height of the view port and change accordingly with the size of the window changing



# Useful tips

- `margin-top: auto` makes the top margin as big as possible in the container the margin is set on

- `::-webkit-scrollbar` changes the scroll bar containter on the body (can also be applied to other containers that have a scroll bar)

Example:
```CSS
/* changing the default scroll bar size (entire scrollbar) */
body::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 1.5rem;
}

/* changing the default scroll bar track */
body::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: #1e1e24;
}

/* changing the default "thumb" that moves along the track */
body::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: #6649b8;
}
```
