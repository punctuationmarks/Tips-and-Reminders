# Flexbox vs Grid
### When to use what


### Flexbox
- For one dimensional layout of columns OR rows
- Flexbox is good for mostly plotting things in rows with multiple columns
- Nothing needs to be overlapped (directly, like div.p over img)
- Allows for flexibility for aligning by column, meaning it can be staggered over each row
- If it wraps, nor not
- Could be used for entire layout, or just a subsection



### Grid
- For two dimensional layouts for columns AND rows
- Allows things to be aligned in two directions, rows and columns
- Allows overlap (directly think of div.p over img)
- Could be used for entire layout, or just a small subsection
	- Think an article and aside on the side of a page
