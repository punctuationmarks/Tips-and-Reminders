## This is a heading, using 2 hash symbols at the beginning of text
### three...

# Quick tutorials for some things that are necessary but you probably won't have memorized. 
And this README is doubleing as reminder on _how_ _to_ "mark down"


Use "_" around a word to make it _italic_

Use "**" around a word to mark it **bold**

Using "[" around the text and "(" around the url, 
this is how we make [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

if you use "!" and then "[" around the text and then immediately "("
around the images' url, you can display it.

Want to make your README look better when you're quoting someone smarter than you?
Just use a greater than symbole infront of the text. 
>"Yes, I said yes I will yes" - Molly Bloom

and if you have a huge amount of quoting to do, just add a greater than symbol 
in front of each of the lines of text (in order)


You want to make list of how to make your program to run?
* Just use one star per line
* And it'll give you 
* A nice, unordered list
* (But make sure to add a space after the '*')
  * Want to have bullet points nested?
  * Same concept of bullet points (with the asterisk but add
  * and indentation under the main bullet point)
