## Markup/Markdown Languages

- Front matter
  - It is akin to adding YAML (yet another markup language) inside the header (typically) of your markdown file, it is used as meta data so you can avoid having a database. This is especially useful for the 2020 common practice of having a client side rendering javascript app with markdown for content
  - There is a npm package called gray-matter which converts that frontmatter into an object for ease of working when using JavaScript
