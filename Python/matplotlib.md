# Matplot Lib


- Always to remember
	- When plotting multiple graphs on one chart, 
		- they are rendered subsequently
		- due to this, the first one is plotted first and then others ontop of it
		- side effect is the first plot could be covered up
	- Be explicit, you're writing this code for others to read it, especially when running in a notebook



- Tips and tricks
	- Need more padding in your graph because some of it is being cut off?
		`plt.tight_layout()`


	- Want to see all styles available?
		`plt.style.available


`
