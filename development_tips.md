- Store a .env file in dev work environemtn to access your environmental variables,
instead of making environemnt variables on your local machine

- When testing, you might get vague error with some of the base tests libraries
	- To combat this, ensure syntax is perfect
	- Also you can run print()/consol.log() or whatever to manually debug your tests



- Make sure to always do a commit of working code before a refactor


- Paths are important obviously, if your path is "correct" double check to make
sure it's not missing a starting slash (or sans a slash)
